## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:

3. **Indian Focus**: Pay special attention to Indian payment methods and merchants
4. **Language Awareness**: Handle both English and Hindi/regional language content
5. **Partial Information**: Even if amount is missing, other indicators can suggest transaction
6. **Multiple Transactions**: If email contains multiple transactions, mark as transaction
7. **Refunds vs Expenses**: Distinguish between income (refunds) and expenses
